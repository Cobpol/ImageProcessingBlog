# ImageProcessingBlog--Skeletonization-K3M
Skeletonization algorithm for Scilab

Scilab algorithms for retrieving image skeleton are highly inefficient because borders loose their connectivity.

Based on this issue new algorithm for the image skeletonization was developed.
Algorithm has name K3M - based on the weighted matrix is very simply to use and gives 1-pixel wide borders without lacks of the connectivity.
